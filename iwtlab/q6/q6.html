                    The Birla Institute of Technology was established in 1955 at Mesra by industrialist and
                    philanthropist B. M. Birla. The institute was affiliated to Patna University until 1960, and then to
                    Ranchi University. In 1986 BIT was elevated to the status of deemed university under section 3 of
                    the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.

                    BIT was the first institute in India to set up a department of space engineering and rocketry, in
                    1964.

                    The Small Industries Research and Development Organization (SIRDO) was set up in 1970 as a launching
                    pad for small manufacturing enterprises managed by graduates of BIT. Companies created from this
                    concept include Meditron and Alcast. This idea was appreciated by Department of Science and
                    Technology, Government of India; and was spread to other institutes such as IITs by the Government
                    with a concept named Science and Technological Entrepreneurs Park (STEP). The first STEP was
                    approved and located in BIT Mesra.[citation needed] The entrepreneurship development cell was
                    founded in 2007 and is run by the students. To add financial strength to this effort, BIT has set up
                    SIDBI Centre for Innovation and Incubation (SCII) by an arrangement with Small Industries
                    Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to provide funds for a limited period of time to new
                    entrepreneurs, start up companies, and technology based organisations in areas of interest with the
                    faculty of the institute. Bit Mesra has a PARAM 10000 supercomputer at the core of its IT
                    infrastructure.
